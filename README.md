#Library management system
a very tiny system

##Books container
*This program uses a "Text file" as the conntainer of the books.
*The books data in the text file are stored in the format:
          book_ID#book_name#book_author(s)#book_publisher
  so each line will store 4 attributes for each book.
*I recommend to create a text file, it MUST be with the name "library-records.txt", in 
  the same path of the executable.
  You can chose whatever name you like, but you need to modify the C code, the "file_path"
  string that I have assigned to the name of the text file "library-records.txt".
